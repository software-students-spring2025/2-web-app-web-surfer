# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

Rental Surfer is a comprehensive apartment rental management web application that connects broker company and potential tenants by providing a user-friendly platform to list, search, and manage available rental properties efficiently. While administrators in the broker company can create, edit, delete housing postings and delete guests, clients, who logged in as guests, can only view and search the desired apartment.

- As an admin, I can moderate and remove fraudulent or misleading listings, so that the platform remains reliable for users.
- As a student, I can search all available rental buildings in my city, so that I can choose my preferred ones to reduce the commute time.
- As a guest, I can search up a specific building for its availability, so that I have the availability of that building and can compare the price with other buildings.
- As a guest, I can view all prices of a specific apartment on the website, so that I know the price of the apartments available in the area.
- As a tenant, I want to compare the prices of similar properties on the website, so that I can assess if I am overpaying and negotiate better with my landlord.
- As a landlord, I want to compare rental prices of similar properties in my area on the website, so that I can accurately price my rental.
- As a guest, I can save my favorite listings, so that I can compare them later and make a final decision more easily.
- As an administrator, I can post my housing details on the software, so that more people can see it and be interested in.
- As an administrator, I can manage the posted rentals, so that guests can have more accurate information about the current rental market.
- As an administrator, I can remove the unwanted guests, so that I can keep the information posted by the company private.
- As an administrator, I can search for a specific user, so that quickly remove they without going through the long list.

#### Data Flow

- When an admin creates or updates an apartment, the data is stored in the houses collection along with references to associated policies, features, and amenities.
- When a guest adds an apartment to their wishlist, a new entry is created in the wishlists collection with references to both the user and the apartment.

### Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Ensure that the MongoDB service is running and that your credentials are correct.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install flask flask-jwt-extended pymongo mongoengine python-dotenv` to install all required packages.
- **Database Connection**: Verify that the MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file is correct.
- **Page Not Found**: Ensure you're using the correct routes as defined in the application.
- **CSS Not Loaded**: Change line 30 (`static_folder=os.path.abspath("../static")`)in test2.py file in the Back-end directory to `static_folder=os.path.abspath("static"))`

### Security Notes

- The application uses JWT for authentication
- Passwords should be properly hashed in a production environment
- Environment variables should be properly secured
